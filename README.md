# WeSplit ðŸ’°

## What is it about?

### WeSplit app is the first project in the [100 Days of SwiftUI](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/100/swiftui) course, by [Paul Hudson](https://twitter.com/twostraws), I learned about Form, NavigationView and @State, through days 16-18. 

## How does it work?
### Insert the total value of your bill, then decide on how many people are paying it and the tip, then let the app do the rest.
